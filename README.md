### Framework motivation
The choice of using React for this project was due to its wide usage and thriving community, and we the developers have some previous experience of using this framework. In addition to this, due to our lack of experience with doing high-quality frontend design, the ability to use existing design libraries like react-bootstrap was enticing. 

Initially we considered using Vue or Svelte. Vue could probably have been a solid choice since it seems to fit small scale projects. Svelte was considered as it appears to be a well received framework that might further rise in popularity in the coming years. 

In the end we chose React as we felt the documentation for Svelte was somewhat lacking in comparison, and Vue would have taken longer to learn. During the time of development we also worked on finishing our Bachelor's theses, which meant we had limited time.
